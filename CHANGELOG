Merged hardware support for Syster from original repository.

Changes and additions:
Default wss signalling has been changed to auto.
Control Word change for Videocrypt TAC mode - tested working on a real TAC card.
Widescreen/anamorphic videos are now appropriately letterboxed instead of being stretched vertically.

Extra options added:
  --position <value>  Set start position of video in minutes.
  --timecode          Overlay video timecode over video.
  --logo <path>       Overlay picture logo over video. Logos are kept in
                      resources/logos folder.

PAL FM deviation changed to 6000000 kHz and default signal level reduced to 0.8

Conditional Videocrypt mode requires --key sky|tac parameter. This specifies
which card you want to use to decode video. 

  sky = this works with an active Sky 11 series card (blue semi-oval logo) and 
        uses two fixed control words.
  tac = this works with an active The Adult Channel or Eurotica card and uses 
        randomly generated control words.

  Hex files for both modes are included in PIC directory to flash your own
  PIC16F84 based cards. Old pirate D2MAC cards based on this chip will work.
  These cards are also known as "Goldwafer" or "Multimac" - only PIC chip
  needs to be flashed. External EEPROM is not used.
