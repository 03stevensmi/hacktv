This is a fork of https://github.com/fsphil/hacktv with some additional features
added. Most of them are those which I personally use, though not necessarily
warrant inclusions into original source.

I will try and keep this as up to date as possible with official releases.

All credit for original code goes to author. Original README text is below.

 -[ HackTV - Analogue TV transmitter for the HackRF ]-

WHAT'S IT DO

Generates a PAL/NTSC video signal from a video file or test pattern.
Input is any file type or URL supported by ffmpeg.
Output can be to a file or directly to a HackRF.
Teletext support.
NICAM stereo audio.
Videocrypt I hardware support.

WHAT'S IT NOT DO (yet)

There are no filters. Needed for proper audio and VSB modulation.
An optional notch filter for the colour subcarrier would be nice.
SECAM colour. More of my TVs support this than NTSC.
D-MAC / D2-MAC standards. Because SECAM isn't obscure enough.

WHAT IT WON'T DO

DVB or other pure digital signals.
Bring back Firefly. :(

REQUIREMENTS

Depends on libhackrf and various ffmpeg libraries.

* For Fedora (with rpmfusion)
yum install hackrf-devel ffmpeg-devel

* For Debian and related
apt-get update
apt-get install libhackrf-dev libavutil-dev libavdevice-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev

INSTALL

make
make install
