 -[ HackTV - Analogue TV transmitter for the HackRF ]-

WHAT'S IT DO

Generates a PAL/NTSC video signal from a video file or test pattern.
Input is any file type or URL supported by ffmpeg.
Output can be to a file (IQ or real, int16_t) or directly to a HackRF.

WHAT'S IT NOT DO (yet)

Streaming support is not optimal. An input buffer is needed.
There are no filters. Needed for proper audio and VSB modulation.
NICAM stereo audio. There is a frame encoder included but no QPSK modulator.
An optional notch filter for the colour subcarrier would be nice.
SECAM colour. More of my TVs support this than NTSC.
D-MAC / D2-MAC standards. Because SECAM isn't obscure enough.
FM modulation. For transmitting to video sender / satellite receivers.
SDR hardware beyond the HackRF is not supported yet.
Proper frame rate handling would be nice.
Proper NTSC colours. They look a bit off on my TV, but that might be normal.

WHAT IT WON'T DO

DVB or other pure digital signals.
Bring back Firefly. :(

EXAMPLES

# Generate a file containing a PAL baseband signal from a video
$ hacktv -o baseband.bin -m pal example.mkv

# Transmit a test pattern on UHF channel 31 (PAL System I), 47dB TX gain
$ hacktv -f 551250000 -m i -g 47 test

# Transmit live NASA TV stream on VHF channel 7 (NTSC System M), 10dB TX gain
$ hacktv -f 175250000 -m m -G 1 -g 10 https://nasa-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/253565/NTV-Public1/master_2000.m3u8
